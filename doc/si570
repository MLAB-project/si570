Description
-----------

The Si570/Si598 XO and Si571/Si599 VCXO provide a low-jitter clock at any
frequency.

The Si570/Si571 are user-programmable to any output frequency from 10 to 945 MHz
and select frequencies to 1400 MHz with <1 ppb resolution.

The Si598/Si599 are user programmable to any output frequency from 10 to 525 MHz
with 28 parts per trillion (ppt) resolution.

See the datasheets for more information.


Sysfs entries
-------------

frequency	- Selected frequency
reset		- Writing a value other than 0 resets the device


General Remarks
---------------

The chips support all valid 7-bit I2C addresses. I2C addresses are assigned
during the ordering process.

This driver does not auto-detect devices. You will have to instantiate the
devices explicitly. Please see Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices for
details.


Platform data
-------------

The devices can be provided with platform data to select the factory default
output frequency. If platform data is not specified, the driver will assume a
default factory output frequency of 125 MHz for Si570/Si571 and 10 MHz for
Si598/Si599.

struct si570_platform_data {
	unsigned long fout;	/* Factory default output frequency */
};
