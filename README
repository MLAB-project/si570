This driver adds support for Silicon Labs Si570/Si571 and compatible chips to
the linux kernel.

To build and install this driver, execute the following command sequence:

$ make
$ sudo make install

If you get an error message such as

make: *** /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.32-32-server: No such file or directory.
Stop.
make: *** [modules] Error 2

you will have to install the correct version of the linux header files. In
Ubuntu, and with above error message, this would be

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.32-32-server
